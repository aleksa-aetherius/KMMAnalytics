# KMMAnalytics

KMMAnalytics is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that lets you send **Firebase Analytics events** from both iOS and Android in a unified, type-safe way.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Single API for logging analytics events on Android (via Firebase Analytics SDK) and iOS (via Firebase for iOS).  
- Support for event parameters (integer, string).   
- Events are auto-generated based on Events.json file making sure the event name and event properties are unified across platforms

---

## ðŸ“¦ Modules & Structure

| Module / Package | Responsibility |
|------------------|----------------|
| `library` | Core, platform-agnostic definition of event models auto-generated from Event.json file|
| `samples/ios` | Example iOS app integrating KMMAnalytics via SPM |
| `samples/android` | Example Android app integrating KMMAnalytics -> To Be Added |

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

Add KMMAnalytics to your project via Gradle:

1. Kotlin Multiplatform

```kotlin
kotlin {
  sourceSets {
    commonMain {
      dependencies {
        implementation("com.example:kmmanalytics:<version>")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. iOS

- Open iOS project
- Tap on File -> Add Package Dependencies
- In Search or Enter Package URL type -> https://github.com/aleksa-aetherius/KMMAnalytics
- Tap "Add Package"

## ðŸ“– Step by step guide for adding a new event

1. Add the event you want to add in `Events.json` file. This is an example of the content of `Events.json` file:
`[
  {
    "name": "home_screen_viewed",
    "params": [
      { "name": "screen_name", "type": "string" },
      { "name": "timestamp", "type": "int" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "purchase_completed",
    "params": [
      { "name": "product_id", "type": "string" },
      { "name": "price", "type": "int" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "cart_added",
    "params": [
      { "name": "amount", "type": "int" }
    ]
  }
]`

2, Run the `generateEvents` script inside `build.gradle.kts`
3. Observe that the events genereted inside `AnalyticsEvents.kt`:
`
import dev.gitlive.firebase.Firebase
import dev.gitlive.firebase.analytics.analytics

// AUTO-GENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT.
fun home_screen_viewed(screen_name: String, timestamp: Int) {
    Firebase.analytics.logEvent(
        name = "home_screen_viewed",
        parameters = mapOf(
            "screen_name" to screen_name,
            "timestamp" to timestamp
        )
    )
}

fun purchase_completed(product_id: String, price: Int) {
    Firebase.analytics.logEvent(
        name = "purchase_completed",
        parameters = mapOf(
            "product_id" to product_id,
            "price" to price
        )
    )
}

fun cart_added(amount: Int) {
    Firebase.analytics.logEvent(
        name = "cart_added",
        parameters = mapOf(
            "amount" to amount
        )
    )
}
`
4. Publish the new version of the library

## ðŸ“± Usage

1. iOS

- Import the added KMM library to the Swfft file from which you want to trigger sending an event
`import KMMAnalytics`

- Trigger the event from the KMM library ->
`  AnalyticsEventsKt.home_screen_viewed(
                screen_name: "home_screen",
                timestamp: Int32(20)
)`

2. Android
